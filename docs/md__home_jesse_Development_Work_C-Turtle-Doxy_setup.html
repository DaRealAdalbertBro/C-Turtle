<div class="textblock"><h3>1.) Getting CMake</h3>
<p>C-Turtle uses an Open-Source tool called CMake to generate "make files", or in the case of Visual Studio, solutions. You can get CMake <a href="https://cmake.org/download/">at this link here</a>. You can download the correct version for your computer by going to the <em>Binary Distrubitions</em> section, where you will find cross-platform versions for Windows, Mac, and Linux. From here, you need to merely install it. All default options are perfectly fine. If you are operating on Linux, scroll past the following image to make this process somewhat easier for yourself.</p>
<div class="image">

</div>
<h4>Side-Note for Linux Users</h4>
<p>CMake is frequently found and installed through the use of package managers. Furthermore, you must install CMake-QT-Gui, the graphical interface for the CMake tool. This can be done on Ubuntu-based distributions through the following command. The graphical tool is installed by default on the Windows distribution of CMake.</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">sudo apt-get install cmake &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get install cmake-qt-gui</div></div><!-- fragment --><h3>2.) Download the C-Turtle Repo</h3>
<p>Next, it is necessary to download the C-Turtle code itself. This can be done by visiting the <a href="https://github.com/walkerje/C-Turtle">GitHub Repository</a> where the code is located, and downloading it. To do so, make your way to the green *"Clone or Download"* button at the top right, then choose to download the ZIP distribution. The steps are highlighted in blue in the following image. Then extract the downloaded ZIP to a memorable location.</p>
<div class="image">

</div>
<h3>3.) Configure CMake to build C-Turtle</h3>
<p>Configuring CMake is quick and easy thanks to its graphical setup. Open the recently installed CMake tool (May be named CMake-Gui), and you will be greeted with the following screen:</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/mFtwViI.png" alt="Image of CMake Program"/>
</div>
<p>The notable components of this interface are the text-boxes labeled "Where is the source code:" and "Where to build the binaries", and the buttons labeled <em>Configure</em> and <em>Generate</em>. For the box labeled <em>Where is the source code:</em>, browse to where you have downloaded and extracted the C-Turtle repo. This folder should contain files such as <em>sandbox.cpp</em> and <em>CMakeLists.txt</em>, as well as a folder labeled <em>src</em> in which the source code of C-Turtle is located.</p>
<p>In the text box labeled "Where to build the binaries", any empty folder will do. For the sake of example, we will set this to a directory named "build" which will be located in the same directory as where the source files are. CMake may ask you if it can create a destination folder, if it doesn't already exist. Click "Yes".</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Og36Ocs.png" alt="Image of CMake Setup"/>
</div>
<p>Next, click the button labeled "Configure" located towards the bottom left of the CMake client. This should bring up a dialog box asking what to generate "make files" or "solutions" for. Select whatever toolchain you would prefer; on Linux, you likely want Unix makefiles, however on Windows you likely want to create Visual Studio solutions. Select whichever option applies for you and click the button labeled "Finish".</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/DnRCoMk.png" alt="Image of CMake Selection"/>
</div>
<p>This action makes CMake process the C-Turtle project for the target you selected (observable by the textual output at the bottom of the client). When this is complete, various options will appear, highlighted in red. The red is not an indication of an error, but rather an indication that the options are new (e.g, were not present prior to clicking "Configure").</p>
<div class="image">
<img src="http://i.imgur.com/l2mOTlb.png" alt="Image of CMake Build Selection"/>
</div>
<p>From here, we can choose what we would like to have generated. For the sake of example, we shall generate the "Sandbox" build, which will generate a "Make File" (or Solution, in Visual Studio) ready-made for students to use in a learning environment. You may also choose to build the Examples, which will add source code of the Examples to the Makefile or Visual Studio solution.</p>
<p>After this, navigate to the directory previously chosen for the text box "Where to build the binaries". Depending on the target chosen for your use case (UNIX Makefiles or Visual Studio) there will either be a Makefile ready to use, or a Visual Studio solution file. From here you can edit C-Turtle's source, or open the solution, which marks the completion of C-Turtle's setup.</p>
<h4>Side-note for individuals not using Visual Studio</h4>
<p>The Sandbox build draws its source from the source file called "sandbox.cpp", located in the root directory of the repo. As such, whenever you would like to mess around with the Sandbox environment, simply edit the contents of this aforementioned source file and run the Makefile generated previously. </p>
